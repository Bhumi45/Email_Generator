# 📧 Smart Email Generator (LLM-Powered)

An AI-powered email generator built using **Google Gemini** and **Streamlit**, created after completing the **“ChatGPT Prompting for Developers”** course by **DeepLearning.AI**.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **prompt engineering concepts** in a real-world LLM-based application.

## 🎯 Project Motivation

After completing the *ChatGPT Prompting for Developers* course by **DeepLearning.AI**, I built this project to apply the learned concepts such as:

- Clear and structured prompting
- Task decomposition
- Iterative prompt refinement
- Temperature-based creativity control
- Using LLMs for generation and transformation tasks

## 🚀 Features

### ✨ Email Generation
- Email type presets (Leave Request, Job Application, Follow-up, Apology, etc.)
- Tone selection (Formal, Polite, Friendly, Professional)
- Length control (Short, Medium, Detailed)
- Creativity control using a temperature slider

### 🔁 Improve Existing Emails
- Enhance clarity and tone of existing emails
- Adjustable creativity level

### 🖥 User Interface
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Real-time AI responses
- Input validation and error handling
